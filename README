Amiga Tools

Really really really old tools written for the Amiga, more instructive as a 
reminder of things past than genuinely useful these days.  They include:


   UnStuff  - Decompresses Macintosh .sit files

   DxfToSdf - Converts 3D models in AutoCAD standard format (.DXF) into Shape
              Definitions (.SDF), a proprietary format used by games for the
              Sega Genesis console

   hunk     - Displays the hunk structure of AmigaDOS executable files

   hunkhack - Adds 'strings'-like text to runtime-self-decompressing
              AmigaDOS executable files, and prevents the orginal compressor,
              Implode, from recognizing the result (to foil nefarious un-
              Imploding and subsequent reverse engineering)

   crlf     - Translates between IBM, Mac, and Amiga EOL markers
